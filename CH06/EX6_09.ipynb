    "# Exercise 6.9: Asymmetric quantum well\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum mechanics can be formulated as a matrix problem and solved on a computer using linear algebra methods. Suppose, for example, we have a particle of mass $M$ in a one-dimensional quantum well of width $L$, but not a square well like the examples you've probably seen before. Suppose instead that the potential $V(x)$ varies somehow inside the well.\n",

    "We cannot solve such problems analytically in general, but we can solve them on the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a pure state of energy $E$, the spatial part of the wavefunction obeys the time-independent Schrödinger equation $\\hat{H}\\psi(x)=E\\psi(x)$, where the Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}$ is given by \n",

    "$$ \\hat{H} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2M}\\frac{\\text{d}^2}{\\text{d}x^2} + V(x) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, let's assume that the walls of the well are infinitely high, so that the wavefunction is zero outside the well, which menase it must got to zero at $x=0$ and $x=L$. In that case, the wavefunction can be expressed a Fourier sine series thus:\n",

If we can calculate the eigenvalues of this matrix then we know the allowed energies of the particle in the well."
