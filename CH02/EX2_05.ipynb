    "# Exercise 2.5: Quantum potential step\n",
    "A well-known quantum mechanics problem involves a particle of mass `m` that encounters a one-dimensional potential step, like shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The particle with initial kinetic energy `E` and wavevector $k_1 = \\sqrt{2mE}/\\hbar$ enters from the left and encounters a sudden jump in potential energy of height `V` at position $x = 0$. By solving the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, one can show that when `E` > `V` the particle may either (a) pass the step, in which case it has a lower kinetic energy of `E` - `V` on the other side and a correspondingly smaller wavevector of $k_2 = \\sqrt{2m(E-V)}/\\hbar$, or (b) it may be reflected, keeping all of its kinetic energy and an unchanged wavevector but moving in the opposite direction. The probabilities `T` and `R` for transmission and reflection are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$T=\\frac{4k_1k_2}{(k_1+k_2)^2}\\\\\n",
    "R = \\bigg(\\frac{k_1-k_2}{k_1+k_2}\\bigg)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a particle with mass equal to the electron mass $m = 9.11 \\times 10^{-31}\\text{kg}$ and energy $10 \\text{eV}$ encountering a potential step of height $9 \\text{eV}$. Write a Python program to compute and print out the transmission and reflection probabilities using the formulas above."
