    "# Exercise 2.9: The Madelung constant\n",
    "\n",
    "In condensed matter physics the Madelung constant gives the total electric potential felt by an atom in a solid. It depends on the charges on the other atoms nearby and their locations. consider for instance solid sodium chloride-table salt. The sodium chloride crystal has atoms arranged on a cubic lattice, but with alternating sodium and chlorine atoms, the sodium ones having a single positive charge $+e$ and the clorine ones a single negative charge $-e$, where $e$ is the charge on the electron. If we label each position on the lattice by three integer coordinates $(i,j,k)$, then the sodium atoms fall at positions where $i + j + k$ is even, and the chlorine atoms at positions where $i+j+k$ is odd. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a sodium atom at the origin, $i = j = k = 0$, and let us calculate the Madelung constant. If the spacing of atoms on the lattice is $a$, then the distance from the origin to the atom at position $(i,j,k)$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\sqrt{(ia)^2 + (ja)^2 + (ka)^2} = a\\sqrt{i^2 + j^2 + k^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the potential at the origin created by such an atom is\n",
    "\n",
    "$V(i,j,k) = \\pm\\frac{e}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0a\\sqrt{i^2 + j^2 + k^2}}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\epsilon_0$ being the permittivity of the vacuum and the sign of hte expression depending on whether $i + j + k$ is even or odd. The total potential felt by the sodium atom is the nthe sum of this quantity over all other atoms. Let us assume a cubic box around the sodium at the origin, with $L$ atoms in all directions. Then\n",
    "\n",
    "$V_{total} = \\sum^L_{i,j,k=-L} V(i,j,k) = \\frac{e}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0a}M$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M$ is the madelung constant, at least approximately - technically the Madelung constant is the value of $M$ when $L \\rightarrow \\infty$, but one can get a good approximation just by using a large value of $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program to calculate and print the Madelung constant for sodium chloride. Use as large a value of $L$ as you can, while still having your program run in reasonable time -- say in a minute or less."
