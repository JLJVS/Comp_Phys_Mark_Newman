    "This result gives a value for the integral on the left which has an error of order $h^4$ -- a factor of $h^2$ better than the error on the trapezoidal rule and as good as Simpson's rule. We can use this formula as a new rule for evaluating integrals, distinct from any of the others we have seen in this chapter. We might call it the \"Euler-Maclaurin rule\"."

    "a) Write a program to calculate the value of the integral $\\int^2_0(x^4-2x+1)\\text{d}x$ using this formula. (This is the same integral that we studied in Example 5.1, whose true value is 4.4.) The order-$h$ term in the formula is just the ordinary trapezoidal rule; the $h^2$ term involves the derivatives $f'(a)$ and $f'(b)$, which you should evaluate using central differences, centered on $a$ and $b$ respectively. Note that the size of the interval you use for calculating the central differences does not have to equal the value of $h$ used in the trapezoidal rule part of the calculation. An interval of about $10^{-5}$ gives good values for the central differences. \n",
