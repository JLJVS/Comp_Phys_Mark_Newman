    "Let our integrand be f(x). Suppose we need to evaluate an integral over the interval from $x=a$ to $x=b$ using Simpson's rule. We'll use $N_1$ slices, which results in the step size $h_1=(b-a)/N_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll apply the trick shown on page 154. Double the number of steps i.e. $N_2=2N_1$ which results in the new step size $h_2=(b-a)/N_2=(b-a)/2N_1=h_1/2$. By increasing the number of steps we reduce the error. From our starting point we know that Simpson's rule introduces an error of order $O(h^4)$, so by going from $N_1$ to $N_2$ we should reduce our error by a factor of $2^4=16$. This gives an order of magnitude for our error.\n",
